# Disto for Mac
Mac Bluetooth helper for Leica distance laser measurement devices. (Leica only provides a windows version…)

## How to use

I do not have an apple developer account and therefor cannot not sign the app.
To use it you have to right click the icon and choose open (or whatever language you have set). MacOS may tell you that it is unsafe to use and you maybe have to go the the security preferences pan and allow to open it. Again this is because it's not signed (A developer account is 99€ a year, but as i share this software for free i do not plan to get one).

If the app opened you will find a small laser icon in the menu bar. Just switch on your Leica Disto and it should connect automatically. If you click on the menu bar icon it should say connected. Now make a measurement. MacOS will ask you to go to the system preferences again and allow assistive devices. Do so and from there on you can measure directly to whatever application you want to use it with.

(The complete process ma seem a little complicated, but it helps us to keep out systems clean and not allow any application to paste potential text to your computer.)

If you need any help feel free to contact me.
