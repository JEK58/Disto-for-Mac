# Disto for Mac
Mac Bluetooth helper for Leica distance laser measurement devices. (Leica only provides a windows version…)

## How to use

I do not have an Apple developer account and cannot sign the application. To use it you need to right click on the icon and choose Open (or whatever language you have set). MacOS may tell you that it is unsafe to use and you may need to go to the Security pane and allow it to open. Again, this is because it's not signed (a developer account costs 99€ a year, but as I'm giving this software away for free, I'm not planning on getting one).

Once the application is open, you will find a small laser icon in the menu bar. Just switch on your Leica Disto and it should connect automatically. When you click on the menu bar icon it should say connected. Now take a measurement. MacOS will ask you to go back to the System Preferences and allow assistive devices. Do this, and from then on you will be able to take measurements directly into your application.

If you need any help feel free to contact me.
